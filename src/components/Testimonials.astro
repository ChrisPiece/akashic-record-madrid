    content: "It took me a while to share this feedback because the reading Bárbara gave me was so powerful and insightful that I needed time to fully integrate the information. Without any context or topic from me, she provided messages that deeply resonated — it felt like she was speaking directly to my soul. Later on, when she asked if I had a theme, I mentioned my work in a very general way, and shared my doubt about my purpose and direction. What she shared in return was completely aligned with my life mission. I highly recommend having an Akashic Records reading with Bárbara. She could have just done the session and left it at that, but instead, she checked in with me the next day to see how I was feeling and if I had any questions. That kind of follow-up and genuine care is rare and means so much more than just the session itself. She also sent me a cleansing decree after the reading — another beautiful gesture that shows how deeply she cares. I was truly touched by this experience and recommend it to anyone looking for guidance and soul clarity.",
