    question: "What are the Akashic Records?",
    answer: "The Akashic Records are a compendium of all human events, thoughts, words, emotions, and intent ever to have occurred in the past, present, or future. They are believed to be encoded in a non-physical plane of existence known as the Akashic Plane. Think of them as the Universe's supercomputer system—a cosmic memory bank that contains information about your soul's journey."
  },
  {
    question: "How do readings work?",
    answer: "Readings are conducted remotely via Zoom or in person if you're local. I begin with a brief meditation to create sacred space and access your Records. Then I'll address your specific questions or concerns, channeling information and guidance from your Records. Sessions typically include a mix of past life information, present insights, and future potentials."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of questions can I ask?",
    answer: "You can ask about relationships, career paths, life purpose, health patterns, recurring challenges, spiritual gifts, past lives, and more. The most powerful questions are open-ended and focus on understanding and growth rather than predictions. I'll help you formulate effective questions during our session."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to prepare for a reading?",
    answer: "It's helpful to spend some time reflecting on what you'd like to gain from the reading and preparing 3-5 key questions. Find a quiet, comfortable space for our session where you won't be disturbed. Come with an open mind and heart—the Records respond best to genuine curiosity and readiness for growth."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I have a reading?",
    answer: "This varies by individual. Some clients benefit from monthly readings during major life transitions, while others find quarterly or bi-annual readings sufficient for guidance and check-ins. I recommend allowing at least 3-4 weeks between readings to integrate the information received before seeking more."
